            The television screen slowly phased into focus some few steps in front of me. Some shopping channel peddling jewelry that people would buy as gifts for their family that no would actually be happy to receive. As the TV came into focus to my eyes and ceased to be a blur in the background of my daydreaming, the thought came to me that I couldn’t really even recall what I had started watching when I sat down in front of the TV in the first place.

            Of course, this wasn’t all that unusual for me. I have always been prone to daydreaming. Deep introspection, analyzing some conversation from the past, or just wondering why anything behaved the way that it did. I was always being accused of being too much in my own head, not present for what was happening around me. Usually by family or friends, or often by the women in my life. The conversations of most people in their daily lives have always seemed to bore me. The platitudes and pleasantries, all so superficial and forced.

            I am a man who enjoys his time thinking on things, and some of my fondest memories were of my time working. I am a scientist. A biochemist to be exact. I’m no Nobel Laureate, but I’m certainly no slouch either. My company has made quite a few pretty pennies off the back of some of my work, and it feels good to be successful at anything you set out to do. That’s something else I try to remind myself to do from time to time. Appreciate where life goes right, and your hard work pays off.

            Here I am getting in my own head again. Talking to myself in loops. Sometimes I wonder if people might think I’m not completely sane if they could have a narration of what I say or think in my head.

            As I sit here on this giant comfortable couch, I feel my body loving the relaxation. The warm blanket draped over me and the soft foam of the cushions. My body certainly isn’t showing me any signs of wanting to get up anytime soon. It’s hell getting older, all these creaky joints and bones, but life is pain, right. It beats the alternative. I don’t see why I should have to get up anytime soon anyway. Since my last big discovery with some simple proteins, I’ve lived the semi-retired life. Plenty of money coming in from that, I certainly didn’t need to worry myself with work anymore. At least not unless I want to.

            As I resigned myself to further relaxing, I refocused on the TV. What had I been watching before this jewelry infomercial crap had come on? Listing my favorite shows one after another in my head, none of them really seem to click.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Screw it, who cares?” My voice echoes out into the quite spacious room.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something about the echo of my voice stirs my mind, and as I take my eyes away from the TV and peer around the room I am quickly taken by mortal terror. As I frantically swivel my head around I realize that I have no idea where I am. I’ve also no recollection of how I got here.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Easy. Easy.” I think to myself. There is no reason to panic right out. I’m a reasonable and logical man. Nothing is coming to hurt me right this moment in an empty room full of chairs and tables and couches. But saying to be calm and staying calm are two different things. My mind races.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Who could have possibly brought me here?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What do they want?”
