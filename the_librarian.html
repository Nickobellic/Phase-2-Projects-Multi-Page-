            In the wake of negotiations with the teacher’s union, the school authorities reached the decision that perhaps it was time for Ms. Betty, the long-serving librarian, to hang up her hat and embrace retirement. Ms. Betty had been a steadfast presence at the school, showing up day in and day out without any notable mishaps for an impressive span of over 39 years. However, amidst the throes of a recession and a prevailing trend of downsizing, the school system opted to usher in technology as a replacement for her.

            “She’s been here forever,” remarked one of the administrators, shaking his head. “It’s time for a change.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But she’s always been so dedicated,” another countered. “Surely we owe her something after all these years.”
        </p>

            “She’s like an ancient artifact,” they declared in a meeting room buzzing with discussions.

            “Let’s encourage her to step aside gracefully. It’s time for a fresh face to bear the responsibilities.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “She has dedicated countless years; let’s afford her the chance to relish the remaining chapters of her life.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Times are changing,” argued a third. “We need to adapt. Technology can do the job now.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It seems she’s lost touch with the younger generation.”

            The director and principal entered the library, their expressions weighed down by the gravity of the conversation they were about to have. The director cleared his throat, his tone somber yet tinged with a glimmer of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ms. Betty,” he began, his voice soft but determined, “we’ve all seen how much this library means to you. And we understand how deeply you care about it.”
