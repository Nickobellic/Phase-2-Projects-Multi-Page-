            A smile covers my face as I look up to see Emily looking down at me as I awake from my nap. I never really took work seriously, something she always got after me for, but waking up to see her beautiful golden silky hair, her bright blue eyes resembling the waters of the Maldives, and well her figure wasn’t anything to scoff at either. This was enough to make me not care about napping on the job.

            “What is it this time honey?” I ask with a smirk
        </p>

        <p>
            She rolled her eyes before pulling me up from the chair “Come on it’s getting pretty busy now. I know we come in early but you are leaving me and Mathew with all the bagging and scanning.”
I sigh and stand up. We live in a relatively small town where, for the most part, everyone knows each other. We work in a local supermarket with the lovely name of Super Emporium. Although there isn’t anything super about it. It’s a small dingy store known for its relatively low prices of meat and fish. The size of the store is small and Emily, Mathew, and I are the only ones who work here during the day

            I walk over to the checkout counter following behind Emily giving her small glances and checking her out. Ever since I met her she’s been the joy of my life. We have been going strong for 3 years now and I’ve been saving up for a ring.
I see Mathew bagging a few items for the current customer checking out. Emily gives me a little shove towards the checkout as I ring them up. Mathew, a bit of an older man, finished bagging sending the customer on their way home, and walked over to me.

            “Hey Cole”
        </p>

I could smell the nicotine coming from his breath. He had a smoking addiction he could never really overcome sneaking a few during work in the break room. How the smoke detector has never gone off is beyond me but, me and Emily suspect he took out the batteries. Not like it matters, it is his business after all a family-owned store he inherited after the passing of his father. He looks at me with a small smile. Ever since his divorce, he’s been different, he seems less motivated, and I can’t help but feel pity that we are the last thing he has. His only friends.

            “What’s up Mathew? Sorry about sleeping in but you know how it goes.”
